### INSIGHTS FOR LEAD DASHBOARD

### 1.	TOP 10 COUNTRIES BY LEADS
•	The USA dominates with 7086 leads, indicating the most significant engagement,
•	While other countries like UK, Canada, and Germany have comparatively lower lead counts.
•	India, Australia and Switzerland have the lowest leads among the top 10 countries
  
### 2.	PRODUCT CATEGORY WISE LEADS
•	“NA” leads with 93%, which means 93% of total are not specified by any category followed by “System”.
•	The “service” and “Consumables” categories contribute minimally, indicating limited engagement in this product types.

### 3.	LEAD TYPE OVER VIEW
•	The majority of leads with 9K+ are not specified by any category.
•	Potential customers have only 41 leads with even fever leads in other specific categories.
Ex: competitor, distributors.

### 4.	TOP 13 SOURCES BY LEAD
•	“Inside sales” is primary source with 2,786 leads followed by the “website” with 2195 leads.
•	Lower performing sources includes “industry event” and “Google Natural Search” suggesting potential areas for increased focus or development.

### 5.	STATUS WISE LEADS
•	Most leads are in the “Naturing” status with (5303) lead counts, followed by “prospect” with 2154.
•	Few leads are qualified (3) or converted (907) indicating a low conversion rate.

### 6.	TOP 13 INDUSTRIES BY LEADS
•	Safety and security are highest with 5357 lead counts, followed by “life science” with 4120 leads.
•	Industries like “Consulting” and “environmental” have minimal lead generation, indicating limited reach or interest in these sectors.

### RECOMMENDATIONS
1.Address the high percentage of "NA" in product categories and lead types by refining data entry processes.
2.prioritize resources for USA, "insides sales", and industries like"safety" and "security" and "life science" to maximize returns.
3.target low- performing countries,industries (ex;consulting),and sources(ex;industry Events) with tailored campaigns.
4.strengthen nurturing stategies to improve conversation rates from "Narturing" to Converted" status.
5.design product and industry specific campaigns to engage potential customers and grow weaker categories like "Service" and "Consumables".

### CONCLUSION
The CRM analysis highlights key areas for optimization in lead management and business growth. While certain regions, industries, and sources (e.g., the USA, “Inside Sales,” and “Safety and Security”) perform exceptionally well, a significant portion of data remains uncategorized, limiting actionable insights. Additionally, low engagement in specific countries, product categories, and lead sources presents untapped opportunities. To maximize impact, the organization must prioritize data accuracy, strengthen nurturing efforts, and focus on targeted strategies for underperforming segments. These steps can significantly enhance lead conversion rates and overall business performance.

#### OPPORTUNITY
### INSIGHTS FOR OPPORTUNITY DASHBOARD

### 1.	RUNNING TOTAL EXPECTED vs COMMIT FORECAST AMOUNT OVER TIME
•	There is a significant spike in the “running expected amt” in 2020, indicating a surge in expected amount.
•	The expected amount plateaus at 184M from 2021 onwards, suggesting the market saturation.
•	The running commit forecast amount grows slowly at 15M from 2021 onwards, indicating conservative commitment.

### 2.OPPORTUNITIES WISE TOP 12 INDUSTRIES
•	Dominance of biopharma/pharmaceuticals sector has the highest number of opportunities (1143), significantly surpassing other industries.
•	With 558 opportunities, state and local sectors are the second largest source. reflecting steady Government involvement.
•	We can see that Biopharma, state and local and NA collectively represents a substantial share of total opportunities. Suggesting specific sector focus.

### 3. RUNNING ACTIVE OPPORTUNITIES vs TOTAL OPPORTUNITIES OVER TIME
•	Total opportunities have consistently grown from 2011-2024.stabilizing around 4645 by 2025.
•	Active opportunities increased until 2023 but seem to plateau after that, indicating a peak or saturation point around 1272.
•	Since active opportunities are for far lower than total opportunities, It suggest many opportunities are either converted, closed or no longer active.
•	Both total and active opportunity growth has showed significantly after 2023.showing a potential market saturation or slower lead acquisition.

### 4.CLOSED WON vs TOTAL CLOSED OPPORTUNITIES
•	The no’ of “total closed opportunities” and closed won peaked in 2020.indicating a high success rate.
•	Both closed opportunities and closed won no’ dropped to nearly zero after 2021, which may suggest a strategic shift, market change or operational challenges.

### 5.EXPECTED AMT vs OPPORTUNITY TYPE
•	The 98% from the total comes from the opportunity which is not specified.
•	Then followed by safety and security opportunity 
•	And lowest is existing Business.
### 6.CLOSED WON vs TOTAL OPPORTUNITY OVER TIME
•	The no’ of “closed won” opportunities fluctuates but shows an upward trend towards recent years
•	This trend suggests improved closing strategies or better lead qualification over time. 

### RECOMMENDATION
1.Explore new markets or innovative offerings to counter stagnation in expected and active opportunities after 2023.
2.captalize on the Biopharma/ pharmaceautical and state and local sectors,which dominate opportunities by tailoring strategies and offerings.
3.Investigate why 98% of opprtunities are unspecified and implement stricter categorization to enable targeted decision-making.
4.Analyse the drop in closed opprtunities after 2021 to identify and address stratergic or operational issues.
5.use 2020's high success rate as a benchmark to refine closing strategies and lead qualification for sustainable growth.

### CONCLUSION
The Opportunity Dashboard highlights a robust growth trajectory until 2023, followed by signs of market saturation and slowing opportunity acquisition. The dominance of Biopharma/Pharmaceutical and State & Local sectors emphasizes key areas for focus, while the high percentage of unspecified opportunities underscores the need for better data categorization. The decline in closed opportunities after 2021 signals potential strategic or operational challenges that need immediate attention. By addressing these issues and leveraging historical successes, the organization can refine its strategies to sustain growth and improve conversion rates in the coming years.
